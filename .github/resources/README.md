# Resources during testing and development

For a quick development experience and fast testing setup, the app needed with
this action is configured using the [app manifest][manifest] and can be used in
experiments with the [Slack CLI][cli].

## Overview

This app showcases all three techniques of sending data into Slack and follows
patterns found in the integration tests.

- **Technique 1** Slack Workflow Builder: Use a Slack webhook trigger to start a
  workflow in Slack Workflow Builder.
- **Technique 2** Slack API method: Call a Slack API method using a token and
  data provided through the GitHub workflow.
- **Technique 3** Incoming webhook: Post a message to a Slack channel using an
  incoming webhook.

Configurations for the Slack app and workflow, and the GitHub Actions workflow
are found in the following files:

- Slack app setup: [`.github/resources/.slack/manifest.json`][slacktion]

Either the techniques or app setup and workflow steps can be adjusted during
testing and development. For experimenting with new changes, we recommend using
the [steps for development](#experimenting-for-development) while the
[steps for CI](#testing-in-ci) is useful when using this app in an actual GitHub
Actions workflow.

### Getting started

Start by gathering credentials of an application equipped for action:

```sh
$ slack install
$ slack trigger create  # SLACK_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER
$ slack deploy          # SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK
```

Gather the **webhook trigger** from the output of the `trigger create` command
and collect the **bot token** and **incoming webhook** from app settings.

Where these are stored will depend on the configurations to run and will follow
in the next sections.

Also be sure to add the new bot to a channel, and while keeping track of that
**channel ID** for posting messages or errors happen.

## Running the workflows

Both setups share the same starting test suite to make sure the similar examples
as in the `README.md` are correct, but changes while testing are encouraged!

The app uses the values stored in `.slack` and can also be adjusted for changing
scopes or workflows.

### Testing in CI

Run the workflow as a complete CI check for the changes upstream.

**Requirements**:

- The credentials collected above
- Access to secrets for the repo

The saved `test.yml` include common workflows from the `README.md` and other
code checks including linting and tests.

Add gathered credentials and [secrets to save][secrets] to the repository being
tested. Required values include:

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: xoxb-01010101-example
- `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`: C0123456789
- `SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK`:
  https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0123456789/B0123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER`:
  https://hooks.slack.com/triggers/T0123456789/00000000000/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

### Experimenting for development

Run the workflow to post messages without pushing changes upstream.

**Requirements**:

- The credentials collected above
- An installation of [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)
- A running instance of [Docker](https://www.docker.com)


```sh
$ cp .env.example .env  # Create credentials
$ vim .env              # Update credentials
$ cat .env              # Reveal credentials
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-01010101-example
export SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0123456789
export SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0123456789/B0123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER=https://hooks.slack.com/triggers/T0123456789/00000000000/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

Environment variables and credentials should be set in the created `.env` file
for use in workflows and actions.

Once credentials are configured and workflows updated, the following command
runs the workflow using `act` and the above settings:

```sh
$ npm run dev  # Test techniques
...
[Local run/run] üèÅ  Job succeeded
```

## Configuring different things

### Changing secrets

To use `${{ secrets.* }}` in the workflow, add more environment variable values
to the `.env` file or update the secrets saved to the repository.

### Mocking event payloads

Different event payloads can be mocked in development with changes to the values
of the `.github/resources/.actions/event.json` file.
